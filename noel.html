   <p> My Poem </p>
   <p> Children should play,
Let them be free to roam the play yards.
	Children should learn,
Get them out of the dust and dirt of those factories,
And back into a school building to get their education.
	Children shouldnâ€™t work,
Let them enjoy being kids while they are young enough to believe in santa.
	Children should be free,
Let them be free until they get tired down to a job for the rest of their lives.
	Children should be children!
